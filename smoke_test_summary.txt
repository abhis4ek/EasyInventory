I ran **static** checks on the fixed package files inside `/mnt/data/EasyInventory_fixed`. 
Important: I could not run PHP or hit HTTP endpoints from this environment, so these checks are file/content validations rather than runtime tests.

Key static findings (high level):
- db.php exists and is present in the package.
- front.php was updated to require db.php.
- get_products.php returns JSON and includes category + supplier fields.
- add_purchase.php and add_sale.php use transactions and prepared statements.
  - add_purchase contains code to INCREASE stock.
  - add_sale contains code to CHECK stock (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE) and DECREASE stock.
- SQL file contains `purchase_items`, `sale_items`, and foreign keys.

Next steps â€” runtime smoke tests you should run on your server (copy & paste):
1) Import the SQL:
   mysql -u root -p < easyinventory_fixed.sql

2) Verify product list (should return JSON with category_name and supplier_name):
   curl -s http://your-server/get_products.php | jq

3) Manual stock flow test (example product id 4):
   # check current stock
   SELECT id, name, stock FROM products WHERE id=4;
   # make a purchase (increase stock) via curl (adjust URL & port, include product_id[],quantity[],unit_price[],supplier_id):
   curl -X POST http://your-server/add_purchase.php -d 'supplier_id=1&product_id[]=4&quantity[]=2&unit_price[]=500'
   # check stock increased
   SELECT id, name, stock FROM products WHERE id=4;
   # make a sale (decrease stock)
   curl -X POST http://your-server/add_sale.php -d 'customer_id=&product_id[]=4&quantity[]=1&unit_price[]=600'
   # check stock decreased
   SELECT id, name, stock FROM products WHERE id=4;

4) Verify purchase and sale records:
   SELECT * FROM purchases ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;
   SELECT * FROM purchase_items WHERE purchase_id=LAST_INSERT_ID();
   SELECT * FROM sales ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;
   SELECT * FROM sale_items WHERE sale_id={id};

If you'd like, I can also create a small Postman collection or a shell script with curl commands to run these runtime smoke tests automatically on your server.
